# What’s Up With Colorado River Basin Water Usage?
## Winning at Twitter with ggplot

##I was trying to think of an idea for the final visualization when I saw this...

## I'm from New Mexico where it has been hammered into me for years that we are imminently headed to a Mad Max future where there is no water left in the Southwest. I have a shower timer in my shower to this day. What is up with John's data?

#### Your Mission, Should You Choose to Accept It, Is to Win Twitter

John's graphs were okay I guess, but I thought I might be able to improve on them to make the unintuitive relationship between water use and population easier to understand. 

So, the goal here is to convince random laypeople on the internet that everything they've been told for years is wrong and you have a max of 3 seconds of their attention.

## Step 1) Horrible Fail





```r
population_time &lt;- Water %&gt;% 
  group_by(Location)

population_plot &lt;- ggplot(Water, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_area()

population_plot
```

## Step 2) Slightly better?
Looks like an oily mess, but at least we're getting somewhere


```r
LasVegas &lt;- Water %&gt;% 
  filter(Location == "Las Vegas")
  
Vegas_Plot &lt;- ggplot(LasVegas, aes(x=Year, y=Population)) + geom_area()

Vegas_Plot
```

---

class: inverse

## Step 3) Hmmm...
So, my first thought was using geom_area to give John's graph a little more color and make the difference in the two lines more obvious. 


```r
Vegas_Plot &lt;- ggplot(LasVegas, aes(x = Year, y = Population)) +
  geom_area(fill = "blue", alpha = 0.3)

Vegas_Plot +
  geom_line(data=LasVegas, color = "azure", aes(x=Year, y=Acre_Feet)) +
  theme_minimal()
```

## What about something really simple?

## Step 4) Lots of Tinkering
I could not figure out how to include a label for "Peak Water" in the legend (I also could not figure out how to change the legend most of the time)

### Step 5) A double Y-axis is generally a no-no, so how about this?
I think this makes it pretty clear that water use is actually pretty stable relative to population? I tried faceting this with the Southern California data but the scale was pretty funky because SoCal has a much larger population.

class: inverse

## Or, Do you get more information from a facet comparison using a proportion?

## Reminder of where we started

Which visualization will help us win the Twitter flame war? One that communicates information quickly (social media lightening speed) to a lay audience who is unfamiliar with water management research.
