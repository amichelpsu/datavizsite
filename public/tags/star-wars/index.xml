      <description>Babynames Sad GraphThis graph was pretty much my first time graphing something in ggplot2!
I would like to polish it up by:
Adding a few more names to it to make it a little more interesting (Luke, Han, Lando…).I’d like to change it to a density plot (I think?) to make it a little cooler looking. Because these names are probably a fairly small proportion of the total babynames, I’d like to do something to adjst the scale so it’s easier to see.</description>
