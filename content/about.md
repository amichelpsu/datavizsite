I've been using R for about...4 months now! Ironically, I have written and edited several stories about very cool things that scientists [have made with R](https://www.psychologicalscience.org/observer/march-methodology-madness-this-is-r-time). 

My BA is in neuroscience, but I discovered I liked writing about science more than working in a lab. I lived in Washington, DC for about 7 years where I worked in health/science communication and policy.

Currently, I'm a first year MPH student in the OHSU-PSU School of Public Health where my concentration is Health Promotion. I'm getting an MPH because I'm interested in learning how to better integrate evidence-based findings into public health policy and programming. What am I even doing in this class? As Jackie said (more or less), the numbers don't mean much to people on their own, you need to tell a story.
