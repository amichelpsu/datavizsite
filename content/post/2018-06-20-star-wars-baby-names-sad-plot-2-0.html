<div id="what-type-of-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>2) What Type of Graph?</h3>
<p>This is a a very simple line graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-description" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Data Description</h3>
<p>This graph was pretty much my first time graphing anything in ggplot2!</p>
<p>The data came from the babynames package and the information for which Star Wars baby names to look for came from a Huffington Post article on the relative popularity of Star Wars inspired baby names.</p>
</div>
<div id="intended-audience" class="section level3">
<h3>4) Intended Audience</h3>
<p>Honestly there isn’t much of an intended audience for this one (me?). I think it could be most useful as an accompanying illustration for an article on the rising popularity of Star Wars baby names.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-am-i-trying-to-show" class="section level3">
<h3>5) What Am I Trying to Show?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Do Star Wars inspired baby names become more popular after a new movie comes out?</p></li>
<li><p>Have Star Wars inspired baby names become “mainstream”? Do they have longterm staying power even years after a movie release?</p></li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-read-this" class="section level3">
<h3>6) How Do I Read This?</h3>
<p>The main components of the graph are time and proportion of baby names. As the proportion increases the line ascends vertically. The use of time on the x-axis allows us to see whether the change in proportion is associated with particular points in time when particular Star Wars movies were released.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>7) Presentation Tips</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Point out that the graph actually starts at 1970, 7 years before the first Star Wars was released. The reason for this is to give the viewer some context for the popularity of these names before the movies.</p></li>
<li><p>Point out that even though the name Leah sounds like Leia the spelling for Leah is pretty common. It’s also interesting that Leah seems to have experienced a bit of a spike in popularity around 2008 – not sure why.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>8) Variations and Alternatives</h3>
<p>An alternative to this line graph could be a bar graph – which would make it easier to see suddent changes associated with particular years.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it-methods-section" class="section level3">
<h3>9) How I Created It: Methods Section</h3>
<p>This was pretty much the first time I’ve ever used ggplot2! I started off by copying Alison’s example and filtering the data for some simple name variations (Leah vs Leia) on spelling. I filtered by sex and year (only including years after Star Wars came out).</p>

<p>This is like, a really sad plot. But, it’s like basically my very first baby step. I think it is successful at communicating the intended information, but it’s really ugly. Most of my changes to this plot focused on improving the appearance.</p>
<p>I started off version 2.0 by adding more information (more names) to help see if there was really a general trend in naming. Then, I changed the colors, the line size, arranged the annotation text to be more consistent.</p>
<p>The main title, axis titles, and legend all needed some tweaking as well. I could have really kept playing with this (changing it to a bar plot or tweaking the theme) but I also wanted to keep it similar enough to the original sad plot that it was still comparable.</p>
