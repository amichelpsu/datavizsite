<h3>Babynames Sad Graph</h3>
<p>This graph was pretty much my first time graphing something in ggplot2!</p>
<p>I would like to polish it up by:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Adding a few more names to it to make it a little more interesting (Luke, Han, Lando…).</li>
<li>I’d like to change it to a density plot (I think?) to make it a little cooler looking. Because these names are probably a fairly small proportion of the total babynames, I’d like to do something to adjst the scale so it’s easier to see. I’m thinking that a density plot of proportion of total Star Wars themed baby names, rather than just proportion of total American baby names, could be one way to do this.</li>
</ol>
<pre class="r"><code>star_wars &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
  filter(name == &quot;Leah&quot; | name == &quot;Leia&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(sex == &quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(year &gt;= 1975)

plot &lt;- ggplot(star_wars, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) +
