<div id="what-type-of-graph" class="section level3">
<h3>2) What Type of Graph?</h3>
<p>This is a line graph.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-description" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Data Description</h3>
<p>This graph was pretty much my first time graphing something in ggplot2!</p>
<p>The data came from the babynames package.</p>
</div>
<div id="intended-audience" class="section level3">
<h3>4) Intended Audience</h3>
<p>Honestly there isn’t much of an intended audience for this one (me?). I think it could be most useful as an accompanying illustration for an article on the rising popularity of Star Wars baby names.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-am-i-trying-to-show" class="section level3">
<h3>5) What Am I Trying to Show?</h3>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Do Star Wars baby names become more popular after a movie comes out? (not really)</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-read-this" class="section level3">
<h3>6) How Do I Read This?</h3>
<p>The main components of the graph are time and proportion of baby names. As the proportion increases the line also increases. The use of time allows us to see whether the change in proportion is associated with particular points in time.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>7) Presentation Tips</h3>
<p>I would definitely include more fun images in this.</p>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>8) Variations and Alternatives</h3>
<p>An alternative to this line graph could be a bar graph – which would make it easier to see changes associated with particular years.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it-methods-section" class="section level3">
<h3>9) How I Created It: Methods Section</h3>
<p>This was pretty much the first time I’ve ever used ggplot2! I started off by copying Alison’s example and filtering the data for some simple name variations (Leah vs Leia) on spelling. I filtered by sex and year (only including years after Star Wars came out).</p>
<pre class="r"><code>star_wars &lt;- babynames %&gt;%
  filter(name == &quot;Leah&quot; | name == &quot;Leia&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(sex == &quot;F&quot;) %&gt;% 
  filter(year &gt;= 1975)</code></pre>
<p>My plot is pretty sad, but I included some annotations to show when various movies came out so that the viewer can figure out if there is a correlation.</p>
<pre class="r"><code>plot &lt;- ggplot(star_wars, aes(x = year, 
                           y = prop,  
                           group = name, 
                           color = name)) + 
  geom_line(size = 2) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1977, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, 
                color = &quot;blue&quot;, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 1999, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, 
                color = &quot;blue&quot;, size=1) +
  geom_vline(xintercept = 2014, linetype=&quot;dashed&quot;, 
                color = &quot;blue&quot;, size=1) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 1980, y = 0.01, label = &quot;Star Wars&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 2004, y = 0.008, label = &quot;Phantom Menace&quot;) +
  annotate(&quot;text&quot;, x = 2009.5, y = 0.005, label = &quot;Force Awakens&quot;)
