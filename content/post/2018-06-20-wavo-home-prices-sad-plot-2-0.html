<p>This is a scatterplot.</p>
</div>
<div id="data-description" class="section level3">
<h3>3) Data Description</h3>
<p>The data for this graph was pre-included in the R package. The data includes quantitative data on real estate prices for Texas, including the city of Waco. The data has been pre-cleaned so that it is easy to work with right out of the box. The raw data includes 11 variables with 139 observations.</p>
</div>
<div id="intended-audience" class="section level3">
<h3>4) Intended Audience</h3>
<p>This could be useful for a homebuyer or a real estate agent, someone interested in whether a particular house is priced high or low for the overall market.</p>
</div>
<div id="what-am-i-trying-to-show" class="section level3">
<h3>5) What Am I Trying to Show?</h3>
<p>There are two main things that I wanted to show with this graph: 1) The general trend in Waco real estate – which is clearly going up over time. 2) Whether particular houses are above or below the median valuation for Waco that year (i.e., is this a good deal or not?). Obviously there’s a lot of other factors to consider, but it’s an interesting way to see the market differences between “low value” real estate and “high value” real estate over time.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-do-i-read-this" class="section level3">
<h3>6) How Do I Read This?</h3>
<p>This scatterplot graph uses a cartesian coordinate system where the year is along the x-axis and the median sale prices are along the y-axis. Each dot represents the median sale price for all houses sold during one month. This graph type is helpful at showing the relationship between house pricing and time – it’s very clear that home prices (even lower valued ones) are going up over time regardless of the economic recession from 2008.</p>
</div>
<div id="presentation-tips" class="section level3">
<h3>7) Presentation Tips</h3>
<p>It’s important to note that the dots in the plot are monthly medians, so if I had more time to get to play with analyzing this I would want to know whether particular months are just bad for sales (maybe including some lines grouped by month?).</p>
</div>
<div id="variations-and-alternatives" class="section level3">
<h3>8) Variations and Alternatives</h3>
<p>There are so many different variations for this type of graph. One that I see a lot is the use of bubbles that are sized according to the magnitude of values such that larger bubbles represent larger values.</p>
</div>
<div id="how-i-created-it-methods-section" class="section level3">
<h3>9) How I Created It: Methods Section</h3>
<p>I initially made this graph as part of the color lab. I initially used continuous colors to help illustrate changes in price overall (higher prices were darker red, lowest prices were yellow).</p>
<p>I started off with a simple scatterplot using median and year variables. I noticed that there were several years in the dataset that didn’t have the needed values, so I filtered for years after 2004.</p>
<p>With help from Emile, I created a new indicator variable (a logical TRUE or FALSE) using mutate to show whether the home prices in a given year were above or below a threshold of the median home price for that year.</p>
