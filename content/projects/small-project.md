Here are some of my [slides](../../slides/Whats_Up_Water.html)

John Fleck is a [professor of water management](https://econ.unm.edu/people/Faculty/profile/john-fleck.html) at the University of New Mexico. He is the father of one of my good friends from high school and he is like, the guy on water policy in the Southwest.  I was trying to come up with some ideas for my final visualization project when I saw John going back and forth with some people on Twitter over data that shows that water usage across the Southwest is actually _going down_ -- and has been for some time (this is not at all what you see in the news).

> ### That's nice I guess, but who cares?
I thought this was a cool example of a strength of visualizations -- you can communicate complicated data really quickly in settings like Twitter. 

Also, this is a really interesting unintuitive finding that shows, as John puts it, that we've generally focused on water supply (which is going down) but water management is also very important.
